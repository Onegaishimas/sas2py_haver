# Feature PRD: Integration Testing Suite

## 1. Feature Overview

**Feature Name**: Integration Testing Suite
**Priority**: ðŸ”µ Important Quality Assurance
**Status**: âœ… Implemented and Production-Ready
**Dependencies**: Data source clients, error handling framework, configuration management

**Problem Statement**: ETL systems that integrate with external APIs require comprehensive testing to ensure reliable operation under real-world conditions. Unit tests alone cannot validate API integration, network resilience, error handling, or end-to-end workflows. Without integration testing, critical failures only surface in production, leading to data pipeline outages and user disruption.

**Solution Approach**: Implement a comprehensive integration testing suite that validates real API connectivity, tests error handling with live services, verifies end-to-end data extraction workflows, and ensures system reliability under various failure conditions. Use real API calls rather than mocks to validate actual behavior and API compatibility.

**Value Proposition**: 
- Prevents production failures through realistic testing scenarios
- Validates API integration compatibility and error handling effectiveness
- Provides confidence in system reliability and data quality
- Enables continuous integration with automated testing pipelines
- Reduces manual testing effort and time-to-deployment
