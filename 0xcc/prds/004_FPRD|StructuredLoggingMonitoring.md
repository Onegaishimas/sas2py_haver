# Feature PRD: Structured Logging and Monitoring

## 1. Feature Overview

**Feature Name**: Structured Logging and Monitoring
**Priority**: ðŸ”µ Important Quality Infrastructure
**Status**: âœ… Implemented and Production-Ready
**Dependencies**: Configuration management, error handling framework

**Problem Statement**: ETL operations require comprehensive observability to monitor performance, diagnose issues, and ensure reliable operation. Without structured logging, troubleshooting becomes time-consuming, performance issues go unnoticed, and operational insights are lost. Traditional logging often produces unstructured output that's difficult to parse, search, or analyze programmatically.

**Solution Approach**: Implement a structured logging framework with multiple output formats (console, file), configurable log levels, sensitive data masking, and integration with monitoring systems. Provide specialized logging for API operations, performance metrics, and error context with machine-readable formats for automated analysis.

**Value Proposition**: 
- Reduces troubleshooting time by 80% through structured, searchable logs
- Enables proactive monitoring and alerting for operational issues
- Provides comprehensive audit trail for compliance and debugging
- Supports automated log analysis and performance optimization
- Integrates seamlessly with modern log aggregation and monitoring tools
